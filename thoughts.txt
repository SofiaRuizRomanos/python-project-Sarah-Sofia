2. How are the different variables (gender, age, geography, etc.) distributed in the dataset?
    * I think here it is straightforward, we have to show the distribution for every variable (
        histogram or bar plot depending on the type of var, quant or qual) and maybe try to show the joint distribution of a few
        But we have tp be careful and think about wether these joint distributions are in reality the answer to question three
        What do you think?
            Ideas for joint distribution:
                - 
                - 

3. How do the different variables interact with each other?
    a. What are the age, salary, balance, number of products, etc. distributions for each gender group?
    b. How are different indicators distributed by country?
    c. etc.
        Ideas for etc:
            -
            -

4. How do the different variables affect churn? What are the causes that can lead to increased (or reduced) customer churn?
    Is this causality? Does this mean we have to do regressions?

5. (Optional) Build a simple machine learning classification model that predicts churn based on a customer's features.


We should also look in the teacher's material to see if there's anything we havent used and thaat it could be interesting. 
Im a bit scared that if we dont the project will be too short, since i think there's a quick and simple way to answer the questions,
but idk if we're supposed to do only that.
